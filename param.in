**** PARAMETERS FILE ****

Number of particles = 100
Number of species = 2
Radius of species 1 = 2.5
Radius of species 2 = 2.5
Valence of species 1 = -2.0
Valence of species 2 = 2.0
Repulsive core distance = 1.0
Diffusion coefficient = 1.0e-9
Repulsive core sigma = 1.0			    	#Hardness
Length of the box = 30.0			    	#Length in Angstroms
Delta grid = 0.20					#1 space over 5 splits = 0.2
Delta time = 1.0e-15				        #Time step in seconds
Min equilibration time steps = 40000			#Min time for equilibration
Max time steps = 280000				    	#Max number of steps
Energy steps = 5000				        #Saving steps for Energy and MSD file
Histogram steps = 40				        #Steps for calculating histogram
tau steps = 1000					#Steps for calculating g(r) and rho(r)
Infinite disolution = 0				   	#0:Homogeneous or 1:Inhomogeneous
Epsilon r = 80.0				        #Epsilon for electrolyte
Temperature = 298.0				        #Temperature in Kelvin(K)

### Macroion parameters ###

Number of macroions = 0					#0: no macroion implementation
Valence = 2.0
Radius = 5.0
Repulsive core distance = 1.0
Position file generator = 1				#0 if you have the positions file

NOTES: 	If you set 1 macroion, the position will be at the box's center. 
		2 macroions will be in the diagonal.
	A tau step times histogram step and you will get the time step equivalent.
		40 histogram steps * 1000 tau steps = 4000 time steps.
